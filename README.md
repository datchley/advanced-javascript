# Javascript: Intermediate to Advanced


This is a short guide on some intermediate to advanced Javascript concepts for new and junior front-end developers.  The goal is not to be comprehensive in our coverage; but focus on those facets and idioms of the Javascript language that we feel will help the developer improve their skills, deepend their understanding of the language and, in the end, write better code.


## ES6 in Examples
Our examples in this book will use the latest ES6 version of Javascript.  We'll also cover specific ES6 additions and features to the language in the "*Working in ES6*" chapter; but we feel that it should be common place to write new projects from scratch using ES6 syntax in conjunction with a transpiler like Babel in your build process.
