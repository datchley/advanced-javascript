This section will cover some of the more important concepts to keep in mind when working with Javascript's basic types, functions as first-class objects, and understanding the implications of Javascript's lexical scoping rules as well.

Our examples in this book will use the latest ES6 version of Javascript.  We'll also cover specific ES6 additions and features to the language in the "*Working in ES6*" chapter; but we feel that it should be common place to write new projects from scratch using ES6 syntax in conjunction with a transpiler like Babel in your build process.
